<h1>Unimaginatively in most cases, rail travel is competitive</h1>

<p>Oversight of a passenger train is the <em>responsibility</em> of the conductor. He or she is sometimes assisted by other crew members, such as service attendants or porters. <strong>During the heyday</strong> of North American passenger <a href="#">rail travel</a>, long distance trains carried two conductors: the aforementioned train conductor, and a Pullman conductor, the latter being in charge of sleeping car personnel.</p>

<h2>Many prestigious passenger train services have been given a specific name</h2>

<p>In order to achieve much faster operation over 500 km/h (310 mph), innovative maglev technology has been researched since the early 20th century.</p>

<p>Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines.</p>

<h3>Even though the cost per mile of construction is much higher</h3>

<p>Monorails were developed <code>body { background: red; }</code> to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a relatively <cite>small part of the overall railway field</cite>. Almost all monorail trains are using linear induction motors.</p>

<hr>

<p>The length of a tram or trolley may be determined by national regulations. Germany has the so-called Bo-Strab standard, restricting the length of a tram to 75 meters, while in the U.S., vehicle length is normally restricted by local authorities, often allowing only a single type of vehicle to operate on the network.</p>

<p>Today, our three-dimensional space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional spacetime, called Minkowski space (see special relativity).  The idea behind space-time is that time is hyperbolic-orthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions.</p>

<p>Before Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–spacetime.</p>

<p>It turns out that distances in space or in time separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time along space-time intervals are—which justifies the name.</p>
